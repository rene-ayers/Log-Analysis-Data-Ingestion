# Log Analysis Data Ingestion

This Python script analyzes system logs to identify potential security incidents and generates a structured JSON report.

---

## What It Detects

- Brute-force login attempts from authentication logs (`auth.log`)
- Blocked IPs from firewall logs (`firewall.log`)
- Intrusion alerts from IDS logs (`ids.log`)
